# water-tank-monitor
With an ongoing drought in my area, our household had 4 rain-collecting water tanks installed. Currently, the only way to know the water level is to knock the side of the tank and guess. I decided to do a simple project with the goal of displaying water levels via a webserver on any internet-connected device.

## Python 3.6.5 Script (Webserver and data interpreter)

### Goal
- [ ] Python script that receives incoming data about water level from an ESP8266 or Arduino and displays it in an elegant graph via a flask web server.
- [ ] Stores historical data.
- [ ] Sends push notifications on configurable water levels and provides a summary of water usage at the end of each month.

### Dependencies:
- matplotlib (> sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib)
- flask (> pip3 install Flask)

## Placeholder for ESP8266 information
